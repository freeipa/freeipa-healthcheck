.SH "NAME"
ipa\-healthcheck \- Check on the health of an IPA installation
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-healthcheck [\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
An IPA installation is a complex system and identifying real or potential issues can be difficult and require a lot of analysis. This tool aims to reduce the burden of that and attempts to identify issues in advance so they can be corrected, ideally before the issue is critical.

.SS "ORGANIZATION"
These areas of the system to check can be logically grouped together. This grouping is called a source. A source consists of one or more checks.

A check is as atomic as possible to limit the scope and complexity and provide a yes/no answer on whether that particular configuration is correct.

Each check will return a result, either a result of WARNING, ERROR or CRITICAL or SUCCESS. Returning SUCCESS tells you that the check was done and was deemed correct. This should help track when the last time something was examined.

Upon failure the output will include the source and check that detected the failure along with a message and name/value pairs indicating the problem. It may very well be that the check can't make a final determination and generally defaults to WARNING if it can't be sure so that it can be examined.

.SS "IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS"
There is no need for users to authenticate and get a ticket in advance for ipa\-healthcheck to work. Existing tickets will not be used as ipa\-healthcheck will leverage the host keytab and use a temporary credential cache.
