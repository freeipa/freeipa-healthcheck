    Base class for tests.

    Most tests use the same set of mocks so centralize and apply them
    once when the class of tests is created.

    A child class defines self.patches as a dictionary of functions
    and Mock values. These are applied once when the class starts up.

    If a test needs a particular value then it will need to use
    @patch individually.

    A default set of Mock patches is set because they apply to all or
    nearly all test cases.
